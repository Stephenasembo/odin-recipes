# odin-recipes
This project is going to be a basic recipe website I am working on.
The website will consist of a main index page(homepage) which will have a few links to a few recipes.
After finishing building this website, I would have demonstrated knowledge on basic html concepts, git basics, working with a text editor and command line basics.
The recipe_structure.html file is a boilerplate for adding more recipe pages to the website.
